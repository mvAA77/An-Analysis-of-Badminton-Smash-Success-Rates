This badminton performance analysis project uses 2018-2023 Badminton World Federation match-play and rally data. We employed a Chi-Square test for homogeneity to verify the assumption that all categories of shots have an equal probability of winning a point, and the results show that certain shots may have higher probabilities of winning a rally.  This study also predicts the success rate of smashes, based on the locations of the birdie and the racket.  Players and coaches can use this analysis to inform both offensive and defensive strategies.
